# Java Memory For the Kids

Last time I worked with Java, it was with version 1.4 while version 1.5 was announced. Today, I need to understand how Java manage its memory while I need to code with it.

Here is a tool to experiment with memory in Java. It works only on Linux and at least Java 1.7. I get memory and process informations int the _proc_ file system specific to Linux. I hope I can extend this to FreeBSD.

Documentation will grow - slowly - with the rest of the project. If I use Maven, I am not a great expert, a lot of people will easily do better.
