# JavaMemoryForTheKids
This project was first named `recallMeJava` but I wanted a real little project which provide a real (little) _Java_ application. Wel, that's nearly done, even if today I spent most of the time to _recall me Java_, playing with functional aspects of _Java 8_ and translate this project to _Kotlin_ - and always play with functional aspects of the language.

## Java
The _Java_ branch and the _Java_ directory contains a _Maven_ project which build a `jar` of the application.

There are one profile for each registererd _Jdk_ :

- sunjdk8
- sunjdk9
- openjdk8
- openjdk9

Each profile needs adaptations to your environment, mostly in the properties.

## Kotlin
The _Kotlin_ branch and the _Kotlin_ directory contains a _Maven_ project which build a `jar` of the application.

There are two profile. Only the _testing_ one have been tested and continue to be tested.
